🔹 Theory for B1 (Write This in Exam)
a. Create Data Subsets:
Subsetting means selecting specific rows or columns from a dataset to focus on required information. It helps in analyzing only the relevant part of the data.

b. Merge Data:
Merging combines two or more datasets based on common columns (like ID). This is useful when data is split across multiple files or tables.

c. Sort Data:
Sorting arranges data in ascending or descending order based on one or more columns. It helps in ranking or identifying top/bottom values.

d. Transposing Data:
Transposing flips rows into columns and columns into rows. This is helpful when we want to view data from a different angle.

e. Shape and Reshape Data:
The shape tells the number of rows and columns. Reshaping means changing the structure of data (like converting rows to columns or vice versa) using pivot, melt, etc.

🐍 Python Libraries Used (With Simple Explanation)
pandas

Main library used for all data operations.

Helps in reading, manipulating, and analyzing data easily.

📌 Key functions:

read_csv(): Load CSV file

df[['col1', 'col2']]: Subset columns

pd.merge(): Merge datasets

df.sort_values(): Sort data

df.T: Transpose data

df.shape: Check shape (rows, columns)

df.melt(), df.pivot(): Reshape data
