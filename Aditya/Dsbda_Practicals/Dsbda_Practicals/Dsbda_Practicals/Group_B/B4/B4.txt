üîπ Theory for B4 (Write This in Exam)
Data Visualization:
It is the process of displaying data in graphical format like bar charts, line graphs, histograms, etc., to easily understand patterns, trends, and insights.

Using graphs helps in better understanding of complex data and is essential in data analysis and decision-making.

For Assignment 2 (Air Quality & Heart Disease) and Assignment 3 (Facebook Metrics), we can use graphs like:

Histogram: To see distribution of values (e.g., age, air pollution levels)

Bar Chart: To compare values (e.g., number of likes on different post types)

Line Plot: To see trends over time (e.g., pollution levels across days)

Box Plot: To detect outliers and understand data spread

Heatmap: To show correlation between features

üêç Python Libraries Used (Simple Explanation)
matplotlib.pyplot

Used for creating basic plots and charts.

Functions:

plot(): Line graph

bar(): Bar chart

hist(): Histogram

scatter(): Scatter plot

show(): Display the plot

seaborn

Built on top of matplotlib with better visual styles and easier syntax.

Functions:

sns.barplot(): Bar chart

sns.histplot(): Histogram

sns.boxplot(): Box plot

sns.heatmap(): Correlation heatmap

sns.lineplot(): Line chart

Both libraries help make data understandable through visuals.
