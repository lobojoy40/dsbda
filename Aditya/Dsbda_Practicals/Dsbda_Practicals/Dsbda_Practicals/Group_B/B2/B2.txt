üîπ Theory for B2 (Write This in Exam)
a. Data Cleaning:
Removing or correcting missing, duplicate, or incorrect data to improve data quality. Helps in accurate analysis.

b. Data Integration:
Combining data from multiple sources (e.g., air quality + heart disease datasets) into one dataset for better analysis and insights.

c. Data Transformation:
Converting data into suitable format or scale (e.g., normalizing values, encoding categories) to make it usable for machine learning models.

d. Error Correcting:
Fixing inconsistencies or incorrect values, like replacing out-of-range values or correcting typos in categorical data.

e. Data Model Building:
Creating a machine learning model (e.g., logistic regression, decision tree) using the cleaned and transformed data to predict outcomes (like disease risk).

üêç Python Libraries Used (Simple Explanation)
pandas

Used for data loading, cleaning, merging, and transformation.

Common functions: dropna(), fillna(), merge(), replace(), apply(), astype()

numpy

Helps with numerical operations and handling missing values.

scikit-learn (sklearn)

Used for building and evaluating machine learning models.

Key functions:

train_test_split(): Split data for training/testing

StandardScaler(): Normalize data

LogisticRegression(), DecisionTreeClassifier(): Build models

accuracy_score(): Evaluate model
